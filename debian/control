Description: Wrapper around sed for safe automated find&sed-ing
 Wrapper around sed that returns with exit code 42,
 if PATTERN wasn't matched and thus ACTION didn't happen.
 Also supports a mode where exit code is 42 unless PATTERN
 was matched exactly N times.
 .
 Example usage: fsed foo 's//bar/' baz.txt
 .
